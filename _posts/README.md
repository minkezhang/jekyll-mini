# Posts

Posts are crawled through recursively. Create subdirectories here if necessary
to organize posts. Symlink to `/assets/` dir as necessary for relative links.
Asset symlinks for posts require specific directories, per
[github.com/nhoizey/jekyll-postfiles](https://github.com/nhoizey/jekyll-postfiles).
